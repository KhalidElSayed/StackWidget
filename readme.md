StackWidget
===========
About
-----
StackOverflow home screen widget. Displays hottest question - click widget to see top 10 hottest.

New in 1.1: - Change question category (newest, by tag) - Switch to other StackExchange sites - Change update frequency

Coming soon: - Save questions and get notified when they get answers

This is only my second Android app and my first widget. Really just doing this to learn, but if people want to use it, here you go! It's on the market and also on Google Code.

New version adds some extra settings (adds support for specifying tags, changing the StackExchange site, setting update interval), changes styles.
